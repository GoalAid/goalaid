GoalAid helps you reach your goal by indicating time percentage in the progress. The colour of green stands for how much time is left to achieve your goal. While the red colour means the time that has passed. The vivid picture of time measurement in colour gives you a clear grasp where you are before your goal and will drive you to take action toward the goal in subconscious. Last, it will give you notifications (text & voice) when time is over.

It is free, safe and no ads at all.
